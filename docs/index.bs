## Terminology ## {#terminology}

This document uses the following terms as defined in external specifications and defines terms specific to Semantic Container.

<div dfn-for=terms export>
    : <dfn lt=DRIs>DRI</dfn>
    :: A **D**ecentralized **R**esource **I**dentifier represents a content based address for a dataset. Within SemCon Multihash [[MULTIHASH]] (default: `sha2-256`) is used for hashing a JSON object and Multibase [[MULTIBASE]] (default: `base58-btc`) for encoding the hash value.

</div>

## Design Goals and Rationale ## {#goals}

SemCon satisfies the following design goals:

* **Open:** all components are open source, free to use (incl. commercially), and publicly accessible (Github, public Repository)    
* **Extensible:** design is inherently supposed to be extended through own definitions, extensions, concepts    
* **Compatible:** allow seamlessly switching between data formats to use the best technology for the given use case
* **Ease of use:** make it as simple as possible (but not simpler!) through documentation (e.g., tutorials, examples) and UI components (databud)
* **Focus on Semantic Web:** build on top of and make use of the Semantic Web Stack
* **Decentralised:** avoid any centralized components or addressing (i.e., use decentralized resource identifiers - [=terms/DRIs=] - where possible)
